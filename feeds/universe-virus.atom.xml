but easily overwhelmed by the resources of a bacteria  
which is overwhelmed by the complexity of a fungus  
which is overwhelmed by the thrust of a single drop of anti-fungal  
which is overwhelmed by a splash of water  
which is overwhelmed by a room heater

which is overwhelmed by a bright-shine of a sun-storm  
which is overwhelmed by the vastness of the sun  
which is overwhelmed by the size of a white "Dwarf"  
which is overwhelmed by its own galaxy  
which is overwhelmed by the number of galaxies in Universe  
which is overwhelmed by ... ?
